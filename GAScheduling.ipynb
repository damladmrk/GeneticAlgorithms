        "\n",
        "In our timetabling problem, the **fitness function** is the key evaluation metric that tells us how good a solution (chromosome) is. Since we can design fitness functions in multiple ways, here we experiment with **two different approaches.** By comparing the two, we can **observe how different fitness scaling affects the behavior of the Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.  :\n",

        "#### 1. Linear Fitness  \n",
        "- Formula:  \n",
        "  `fitness = K - penalty`  \n",
        "- Idea: Start with a high score (e.g., 4000) and subtract penalties for every violation of hard or soft constraints.  \n",
        "- Pros:  \n",
        "  - Keeps a wide range of fitness values, making it easier to differentiate between solutions.  \n",
        "  - Even “bad” solutions still get nonzero scores, which helps in selection.  \n",
        "- Cons:  \n",
        "  - Requires choosing a proper `max_score`. If it’s too low, many solutions will drop to zero; if it’s too high, penalties might look too small.  \n",

        "  `fitness = 1 / (1 + penalty)`  \n",
        "- Idea: Fitness decreases inversely with the penalty. If the penalty grows large, fitness quickly approaches zero.  \n",
        "- Pros:  \n",
        "  - Strongly punishes invalid or poor solutions (they almost collapse to 0).  \n",
        "  - Guarantees a bounded range: always between (0, 1].  \n",
        "- Cons:  \n",
        "  - Bad solutions are hard to differentiate (most values cluster near zero).  \n",
