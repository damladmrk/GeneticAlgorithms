# Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of small projects and experiments I developed while learning **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** as part of self-study journey.  
The goal of this work is to better understand optimization methods, evolutionary computation, and their applications in different problem domains.  

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included
- **Beginner Scratch Implementation**: Coding fittness, crossover, mutation etc. functions.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Trying params in SVM's and NN's using GA.  
- *(more experiments will be added as I learn and explore)*
